✦Alone Among the Stars✦
By Takuma Okada | noroadhome.itch.io
A solo roleplaying game about exploring fantastic planets
You are a solitary adventurer, hopping from planet to planet
exploring. Each world has unique features for you to discover
and record. They are represented by cards from a standard
deck, placed face down.
To find a new planet, roll a six-sided die and place cards face
down equal to the number rolled.
To flip over a card to discover something, roll a six-sided die:
On a 1-2 it is arduous to get to.
On a 3-4 you come upon it suddenly.
On a 5-6 you spot it as you are resting.
The suit and rank determine the discovery. In your ship’s log
(a small journal if you have one), record a short description
and your reaction in a few sentences, and roll for the next
card. Each time you complete a planet, give it a number or a
name, and find a new planet.
Play until you are tired, and want to return home. If you
want to remember your travels, save the journal. If the
memories bring you pain, burn it.
